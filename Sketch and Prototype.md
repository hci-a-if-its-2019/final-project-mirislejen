### 4. Design Rationale
The sketch and its selection are made by making oneself seeing the problem from the perspective without minding advanced techniques one know. Using this method, one will know what's wrong with the interface and what should one do to make it better.<br/><br/>

For problems in Artifact 0, the main problem is the size of "Jual" font size, so it is mandatory to make it bigger. As for the unneeded keywords, it is sufficient just by removing the feature.

For problems in Artifact 1 and 2, the explanation text problem can be solved by making it more contrast. The other problem, redundant way to close the login/register pop up, it is sufficient by disabling one method to close the pop up.<br/><br/>

for problems in Artifact 3, it is enough to solve the problem by making a register button on the seller's login page.<br/><br/>
