### 3. Selected Sketch and Design Rationale
**Artifact 1: Solution 2**<br/>
Many famous websites, i.e. facebook, twitter, etc., place their important button on the upper right side of page. It makes many people tend to look for upper right page when they search for something.<br/>
<br/>
**Artifact 2: Solution 2**<br/>
Even though Solution 1 is feasible, it is mostly used for devices with small screen (We limit our case to desktop version website).<br/>
<br/>
**Artifact 3: Solution 2**<br/>
When someone new want to login into website, they always look for login part in page. It is better for user to immediately find register button/hyperlink when they looking for login (Solution 1 can be implemented if the owner of the website want to go for consistency).<br/>
<br/>
**Artifact 4: Solution 1**<br/>
Using Solution 1, user can get the information of items faster than SOlution 2. In fact, Solution 2 may pose a problem for user that don't know the item explanation will be displayed after they click it.<br/> 
<br/>
**Artifact 5: Solution 2**<br/>
Solution 2 is more preferred because it's easier for user to get to know possible actions that can be made when the features are clustered (Solution 1 "Hapus Variasi" button placed far from "Ok" button).<br/>
<br/>
**Artifact 6: Solution**<br/>
It's mandatory for user to have control over information displayed. The original interface force the user to understand to choose "Provinsi" > "Kabupaten" > "Kecamatan" in succession. This solution breakdown the components so the user can understand faster how to fill the address without the need to click the button first.<br/> 
<br/>
**Artifact 8: Solution**<br/>
User must be able to understand the warning they got, including the user's choice provided by system. It makes the distinction between choice have to be clear for user. Solution provided makes user able to differentiate the choice displayed to them easier.<br/>
